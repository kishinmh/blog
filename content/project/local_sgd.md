summary = "This Project is to be submitted at AISTATS 2019! We give the first non-asymptotic analysis of the Local-SGD algorithm and compare it with the extreme variants of One-shot and Mini-batch averaging. We also provide lower bounds on communication frequency for Local-SGD to perform optimally i.e. constant times worse than Mini-batch averaging. Finally, we conduct experiments to verify our theoretical findings. Our work hugely improves upon the communication bottleneck faced by distributed optimization algorithms. Arxiv version coming soon..."
