summary = "We first do a brief review of some recent attempts to model sparse learning in humans, using non-paramteric statistics. We present our computational model of one shot learning, an area broadly studied in machine learning using non-parametric Bayesian modelling. It is followed by some experiments with human subjects to prove a part of this hypothesis. We verify a former hypothesis which links surprise to sparse learning of reward-penalty correlation with image stimuli."
