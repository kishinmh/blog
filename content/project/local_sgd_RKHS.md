summary = "In continuation to the project on Local SGD, we are trying to analyse the infinite-dimensional setting. Our motivation is to understand the asymptotic constants involved in the converegence of Local SGD, hence understanding its behaviour more closely. We work in possibly infinite-dimensional RKHS setting, which has been previously used to give tighter rates for SGD like algorithms."
