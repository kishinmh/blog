summary = "We leverage variational auto-encoders to provide a novel generational model for controlled paraphrasing, using attention, and pre-fixed latent variables. Our results are qualitatively and quantitatively comparable to existing state of the art techniques.  We also experiment with the popular evaluation techniques in Machine Translation like Bleu, etc. and demonstrate how they are insufficeint for the paraphrasing task."
