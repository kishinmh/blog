abstract_short = "We present algorithms for solving multi-armed and linear-contextual bandit tasks in the face of adversarial corruptions in the arm responses. Our algorithms are easy to implement and vastly outperform several existing UCB and EXP-style algorithms for stochastic and adversarial multi-armed and linear-contextual bandit problems. They enjoy minimax-optimal regret bounds, as well as can tolerate an adversary that is allowed to corrupt upto a universally constant fraction of the arms pulled by the algorithm."
