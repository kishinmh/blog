summary = "We are compiling a new data-set which can be used for the supervised training of Neural information retrieval models. We are also working on improving the existing neural-IR techniques by combining new ideas from deep learning with established principles in classic IR techiques. Our motivation is to leverage neural network techniques in relatively unexplored IR."
