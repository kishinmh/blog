# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "This project has produced a publication in Springer Machine Learning Journal! We developed novel algorithms for multi-armed and linear bandits, with provably optimal mini-max guarantees, and corruption tolerance against a universally corrupting adversary. Our algorithms experimentally outperform the state of the art UCB and EXP style algorithms with a huge margin."
