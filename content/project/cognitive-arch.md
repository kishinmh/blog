summary = "We develope on the existing cognitive architecture based on fuzzy Z-numbers and recent work in cognitive sciences. Specifically we add skills like extraction and consolidation to the architecture by linking language processing levels in linguistics to atomic cognitive abilities and operators defined in the model. In doing so we leverage the current Z*-algebra and knowledge representation techniques."
