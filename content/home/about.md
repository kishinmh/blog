# Biography

I am a senior undergraduate at the department of computer science and engineering, IIT Kanpur. Currently, I am on a semester exchange to EPFL. I have been working on distributed stochastic optimization with [Dr. Martin Jaggi](http://people.inf.ethz.ch/jaggim/) and [Dr. Aymeric Dieuleveut](https://www.di.ens.fr/~dieuleveut/) at the [Machine Learning and Optimization laboratory](https://mlo.epfl.ch/), EPFL and on neural information retrieval with [Dr. Navid Rekabsaz](http://navid-rekabsaz.com/) at [IDIAP](https://idiap.epfl.ch/), EPFL. Previously I was working with [Dr. Purshottam Kar](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/purushot/) at IIT Kanpur, on robust bandit optimization. I am also working on our startup Socrazia which works on leveraging AI techniques for social problems in India, including agriculture, healthcare, teaching, etc. 

I am applying for Doctoral positions starting Fall 2019, please contact if you have a suitable position.
