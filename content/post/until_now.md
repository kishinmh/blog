I hail from the small town of [Neemuch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neemuch) in Central India at the border of the two states of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. I have grown up in a classic nuclear-joint-nuclear family with a dog and am in love with the small-town/village culture of India, which I have proudly been a part of for atleast the first 16 years of my life. I completed my primary and middle school in [Spring Wood School](http://springwoodschool.in/) Neemuch, while I trained in the Hindustani Classical Music for four years at the [Gandharva Sangit Mahavidhyalaya](http://abgmvm.org/), Neemuch. I completed my high school from [Shiv Jyoti School](http://shivjyoti.org/rathkankara/index.php), Kota while studying at [Allen Career Institute](https://www.allen.ac.in/) for one of the most rigorous exams in the world, IIT-JEE Advanced. I ranked 200 amongst the 1.3 million students appearing for JEE-2015 and got admitted to the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/) for the B.Tech program in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/). I made the fullest use of my freshmen year in exploring the multiple facets of university life including Music, Debating, Oratory, Journalism, Student Politics and most importantly studying some of the core engineering courses like Multivariate Calculus and Linear Algebra. I spent my freshmen summer teaching myself the basics of Machine Learning and reading interesting research papers in the field, something I was going to love for a very very long time.

During the sophomore year I kept working on my ML skills and worked as a data science intern at [3LOQ Labs](https://3loq.com/), Hyderabad while attending the essential computer science courses. I also got introduced to machine learning theory for the first time and worked on my first proper research project on Bandit Algorithms with [Puru](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/purushot/) and [Sayash](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/sayash/). I got selected into the International cultural exchange program by [Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports](https://yas.nic.in/), and became a part of the [Indian Delegation to Nepal](https://kishinmh.github.io/Nepal%20Youth%20Delegation%202016.pdf) (my report for teh programme). It was indeed  one of the most remarkable experiences of my life! I spent my summer at the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata working under [Dr. Sankar K. Pal](https://www.isical.ac.in/) on a project in cognitive architecture which still continues. I also explored the area of Cognitive science during my junior year. Continuing on our Bandits project from before, we submitted it to conferences like AAAI, ALT and ECML-PKDD (We recently got our work published at the [Springer machine learning journal](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-018-5758-5) after getting a positive review from ECML-PKDD). After a very rigorous selection procedure I was awarded the [Honda Yes Fellowship and Award](http://yes.honda.co.in/index.aspx) by the Honda Foundation, which aided me with $10,000 worth of scholarship and a future internship in Japan at a research Laboratory. In the Junior Year, I also studied the probabilistic approach to machine learning, while working on a NLP-Deep Learning project for the first time with [Dr Piyush Rai](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/piyush/). I spent my junior winter break at [MLO](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/piyush/) lab, EPFL working with [Martin](https://people.epfl.ch/martin.jaggi) and [Aymeric](https://www.di.ens.fr/~dieuleveut/) on the omnipotent SGD algorithm in the distributed setting. Then, began my spring exchange semester at EPFL. I really enjoyed the semester by doing a breadth of courses in AI including Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, Optimization and in related mathematical theory including Time Series Analysis and Applied Stochastic Process as well as hiking, running and visiting some of the best places in Switzerland and europe with ESN, family, Sayash and my wingies. After working for a few months on local SGD we were able to get some really interesting results, which we submitted to NIPS'18. During the summer I continued working at MLO after a brief vacation in Cinque-Terre. We didn't get in NIPS and are currently working on submission to AISTATS'19. I have also been exploring a new area of high-dimensional statistics, for extensions on Local SGD. Since I am applying for doctoral programs this year, I planned on exploring the field of natural language processing which I have always found interesting by working with [Dr. Navid Rekabsaz](http://navid-rekabsaz.com/) from [IDIAP](https://idiap.epfl.ch/) on neural IR models. Currently I am too busy with all my scholarship deadlines, two approaching conference deadlines, looking around for PhDs, our upcoming social startup Socrazia and ending vacations. I am also looking forward to the coming semester. I plan on taking courses in machine learning and intelligent agents as well as strengthen my mathematical understanding of statistics and data science. If you find my story interesting and have a doctoral position to offer, feel free to [mail me](mailto:kumar.patel@epfl.ch) regarding the same. Rest later!
